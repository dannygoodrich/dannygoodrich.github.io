    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>Software developer proficient in front-end and back-end languages. I use my previous food service management experience to plan time-sensitive projects in an efficient manner. I thrive while engaging  in problem solving, troubleshooting activities, and crisis management. I’m naturally driven to analyze information, always searching for discrepancies and errors. I use my analytical skills to evaluate projects, people, and information, in order to suggest improvements that benefit business goals. I am consistent, easy to work with, and quick to find and address problems.
